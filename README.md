# Hangman-Game-in-Kivy
This is a simple Hangman Game where the player has to guess the name of a character from different categories.
The name of the characters are in spanish, because I want to upload the game to Google Play, and the original file I made is in Spanish.
Also, the Android version I made is different, but I'm not goint to upload it because it doesn't look good on Pc. 
## Requirements
* Python3
* Kivy
